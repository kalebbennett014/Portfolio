# Strengths and Weaknesses of Developing IT-230 Application

Q: Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user need was this application designed to address?

A: The application I developed is a WPF student registration system. Its main goal is to allow users to register students for college courses through a simple and intuitive interface. It was designed to address the need for managing student data and course enrollments efficiently. The application lets users enter student information, select courses, and register them while displaying all relevant details clearly. This helps automate and streamline the process, reducing manual paperwork and improving accuracy. :)


Q: What did you do particularly well in developing this application?

A: One thing I did particularly well in developing this application was organizing the code to make it clear and easy to follow, especially the way I handled data validation and user interactions. I made sure that the inputs were checked properly before allowing a student to register, which helped prevent errors. I also used proper WPF controls and layout techniques to build a clean and user-friendly interface. This made the application not only functional but also intuitive for users.


Q: Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A: The Console version of the app is very basic and text-based. It requires users to type commands and navigate using keyboard inputs. While functional, it lacks visual feedback and can be confusing for users who aren’t familiar with command-line interfaces. It’s also harder to validate inputs and guide users through the process step by step.
  In contrast, the WPF version has a graphical user interface with buttons, text boxes, drop-down lists, and labels. This design is more visual, intuitive, and user-friendly. It allows users to interact with the application more naturally using a mouse and keyboard, and it provides immediate visual feedback for their actions.


How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?

A: When I was working on the app, I tried to take it one step at a time. I didn’t try to build everything all at once. First, I made sure the main screen showed up correctly. Then I added the parts for entering student info, and finally, I connected it all together so it actually registered the students. When things didn’t work, I used the Visual Studio debugger to pause the program and see what was happening behind the scenes. That helped me figure out where things were going wrong. Sometimes I also printed out values just to check if things were working the way I expected. I tested the app a lot as I built it, even after small changes, so I could catch problems early. This approach really helped make debugging easier. In the future, I’ll keep doing it this way because it keeps things simple and less stressful, and it helps me fix problems faster.


Q: Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?

A: One challenge I ran into was making sure users couldn’t register a student without filling out all the info. I had to think of a smart but simple way to check for missing details without making the app annoying to use. I came up with a clean solution that keeps things smooth and user-friendly.
Another tricky part was getting the app to show registered students right after they were added. I figured out how to make the data update automatically so users get instant feedback, which makes the app feel more polished and professional.
These small improvements made a big difference. They helped turn a basic form into something that feels modern, easy to use, and ready for real-world use—exactly what you want if you're building something people can rely on.
